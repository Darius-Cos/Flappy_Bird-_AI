Flappy Bird with AI üê¶ü§ñ
Overview
Welcome to the Flappy Bird with AI project! This desktop application reimagines the classic Flappy Bird game by integrating an artificial intelligence system powered by the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. Watch as the AI learns to navigate the bird through a series of pipes, evolving over generations to improve its performance. Test the limits of machine learning in a fun and interactive way!

Features
AI-Driven Gameplay: A neural network controls the bird, learning to avoid pipes through evolution.
Dynamic Obstacles: Pipes are generated randomly, challenging the AI to adapt.
Score System: Tracks the number of pipes successfully passed by the AI.
Generation Tracking: Displays the current generation and number of birds alive.
Real-Time Visualization: See the bird‚Äôs movements and the AI‚Äôs decision-making process unfold live.
Smooth Animations: Enjoy a visually appealing and responsive game experience.
Getting Started
Installation:
Clone the repository or download the source code from GitHub.
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required dependencies by running:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
pip install pygame neat-python
Running the Game:
Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
Run the following command: python flappy_bird_ai.py
The game window will open, and the AI will begin training immediately!
Playing the Game
The game is fully autonomous‚Äîsit back and watch the AI control the bird!
The bird jumps based on decisions made by the neural network, aiming to avoid pipes.
The game continues across generations, with the AI improving its strategy over time.
Close the window to stop the simulation.
Rules üìú
The bird moves forward automatically, and the AI decides when to jump.
Each time the bird passes a pipe, the score increases, and the AI earns a fitness boost.
The game ends for a bird when it collides with a pipe, the floor, or flies too high.
The simulation runs for up to 50 generations or until the AI achieves a high score.
About üìò
This project combines the nostalgic Flappy Bird game with cutting-edge AI technology. Built using Python, Pygame, and NEAT-Python, it demonstrates how neural networks can learn complex tasks through evolutionary algorithms. It‚Äôs a great showcase of machine learning applied to game development, blending entertainment with education.

Contribution
Contributions are always welcome! If you have ideas for enhancements‚Äîlike tweaking the NEAT configuration, adding new features, or improving the UI‚Äîfeel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
